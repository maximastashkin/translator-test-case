api.operation=Performs word-by-word translation of a string (each word separately) using an external api
api.responses.ok=Returns the translated string
api.responses.bad_request=May be returned if language codes are not in ISO-639-1 or empty text on input - in this case code: 1 (BAD_REQUEST). It can also be returned if the external API does not support one of the languages (source / target) - in this case, code: 4 (EXTERNAL_TRANSLATION_API_UNSUPPORTED_LANGUAGE)
api.responses.internal_error=May be returned if the external translation api is not available or became unavailable at the time of translation, code : 2 (EXTERNAL_TRANSLATION_API_NOT_AVAILABLE). It may also be returned if an error occurred on the side of the external api (for Yandex, for example, a limit of 20 requests per second - can sometimes occur), code: 3 (EXTERNAL_TRANSLATION_API_ERROR) - in this case, it is worth repeating the request later.
